				<p>I've never been much of a *blog person*. I think it takes a certain amount of arrogance to believe that your opinion is important enough to justify blogging on any particular topic. However, I am making a committment to write more and writing by hand was giving me wrist pain so here I am typing up a blog post! This will probably not be so focused on science, but rather on my feelings and experiences of research and oceanography. And maybe, just maybe, 2 years of PhD research has given me the arrogance to think this is a good idea.</p>
