					<h4>Communication with the public</h4>

				<p>I find it interesting that when we discuss scientists communicating with the public, it is rarely framed in the way of "what can science take from *the public* in order to better communicate?" Not just to the public, but to each other as well. Take for example, emojis. A form of communication that you would never use in a formal scientific presentation, and probably wouldn't use much even in a conversation with the public. And yet.... I truly I would be more effective at reading papers if Mendeley let me insert emojis into my comments. I can remember specific moments of reading papers when I rolled my eyes at an assumption, or laughed at interesting vocabulary choice. <b>And I remember those moments</b>. When I am looking back at the paper, I'm frequently like "shit, where was that section where I rolled my eyes?" We (even scientists) remember emotion. I am much more likely to remember something if I can connect it to a specific emotion: disagreement, disbelief, amazement, the emotion itself doesn't matter. So for now I will continue to advocate for emojis in Mendeley, and maybe even at conferences.</p>

					<h4>On blogging as a concept, or my meta-blogging</h4>

				<p>I've never been much of a <i>blog person</i>. I think it takes a certain amount of arrogance to believe that your opinion is important enough to justify blogging on any particular topic. However, I am making a committment to write more and writing by hand was giving me wrist pain so here I am typing up a blog post! This will probably not be so focused on science, but rather on my feelings and experiences of research and oceanography. And maybe, just maybe, 2 years of PhD research has given me the arrogance to think this is a good idea.</p>
