					<h4>Research</h4>
				</header>
				<p>I am a PhD student in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, under the supervision of Dr. Lisa Beal. My research focuses on the heat transport of the Indian Ocean, with a particular focus on the Agulhas Current. I am first and foremost an observationalist, and I am very excited to gain more cruise experience as part of my PhD.</p>

					<h4>Other Interests</h4>
				</header>
				<p>I am an avid runner. In 2015 I completed the Miami Marathon, and on my 21st birthday I ran the Chicago Ultramarathon 50 km. Recently, I'm more interested in 5k's to half marathons, however I do hope to run the Boston Marathon and the Two Oceans (ultra) Marathon sometime in the next few years. I also work with the University of Miami undergraduate chapter of <a href="https://www.ostem.org/">oSTEM</a>, a national organization which promotes education and leadership of LGBTQ people in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.</p>
